# provide detailed explanation of osi model, use professional terminology

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the late 1970s as a reference model for defining standards for communication between different systems. The OSI model consists of seven distinct layers, each with specific functions and protocols, enabling communication between diverse systems.

1. Physical Layer:
   The physical layer is responsible for the physical transmission of raw data bits over a communication channel. It defines the electrical, mechanical, functional, and procedural specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between network nodes. This layer deals with the physical characteristics of the communication medium, such as voltages, cable specifications, connectors, and signal timing.

2. Data Link Layer:
   The data link layer is responsible for reliable data transfer between adjacent nodes on a network. It ensures that data frames are delivered without errors, handles flow control, and detects and corrects physical-layer errors. This layer also defines mechanisms for framing, addressing, and error detection and correction. It is further divided into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer.

3. Network Layer:
   The network layer is responsible for logical addressing, routing, and determining the path for data transmission across interconnected networks. It handles logical addressing, routing protocols, and congestion control mechanisms. This layer enables data to be transferred between different networks by forwarding data packets from source to destination based on logical addresses (e.g., IP addresses).

4. Transport Layer:
   The transport layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication between applications running on different hosts. It handles segmentation, flow control, and error correction to provide reliable data delivery. This layer also establishes and terminates communication sessions between applications. The two primary protocols at this layer are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

5. Session Layer:
   The session layer establishes, manages, and synchronizes communication sessions between applications. It handles checkpointing, recovery, and restart procedures to ensure that data is transmitted reliably and in the correct sequence. This layer also provides mechanisms for coordinating communication between applications, such as token management and session resumption.

6. Presentation Layer:
   The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data is represented in a format that both the sending and receiving systems can understand. This layer handles data encoding, encryption, and compression/decompression, as well as character set conversion and multimedia formatting.

7. Application Layer:
   The application layer is the layer closest to the end-user, providing services and interfaces for applications to access the network services. It defines protocols for specific applications, such as HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, and FTP for file transfer. This layer also handles user authentication, authorization, and application-level services.

The OSI model provides a standardized framework for designing and implementing network protocols, enabling interoperability between diverse systems and networks. While not all networking implementations strictly adhere to the OSI model, it serves as a valuable reference for understanding and troubleshooting network communications.
