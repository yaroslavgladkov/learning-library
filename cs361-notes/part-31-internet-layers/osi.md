# provide detailed explanation of osi model, use professional terminology

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the late 1970s as a reference model for defining standards for communication between different systems. The OSI model consists of seven distinct layers, each with specific functions and protocols, enabling communication between diverse systems.

1. Physical Layer:
   The physical layer is responsible for the physical transmission of raw data bits over a communication channel. It defines the electrical, mechanical, functional, and procedural specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between network nodes. This layer deals with the physical characteristics of the communication medium, such as voltages, cable specifications, connectors, and signal timing.

2. Data Link Layer:
   The data link layer is responsible for reliable data transfer between adjacent nodes on a network. It ensures that data frames are delivered without errors, handles flow control, and detects and corrects physical-layer errors. This layer also defines mechanisms for framing, addressing, and error detection and correction. It is further divided into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer.

3. Network Layer:
   The network layer is responsible for logical addressing, routing, and determining the path for data transmission across interconnected networks. It handles logical addressing, routing protocols, and congestion control mechanisms. This layer enables data to be transferred between different networks by forwarding data packets from source to destination based on logical addresses (e.g., IP addresses).

4. Transport Layer:
   The transport layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication between applications running on different hosts. It handles segmentation, flow control, and error correction to provide reliable data delivery. This layer also establishes and terminates communication sessions between applications. The two primary protocols at this layer are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

5. Session Layer:
   The session layer establishes, manages, and synchronizes communication sessions between applications. It handles checkpointing, recovery, and restart procedures to ensure that data is transmitted reliably and in the correct sequence. This layer also provides mechanisms for coordinating communication between applications, such as token management and session resumption.

6. Presentation Layer:
   The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data is represented in a format that both the sending and receiving systems can understand. This layer handles data encoding, encryption, and compression/decompression, as well as character set conversion and multimedia formatting.

7. Application Layer:
   The application layer is the layer closest to the end-user, providing services and interfaces for applications to access the network services. It defines protocols for specific applications, such as HTTP for web browsing, SMTP for email, and FTP for file transfer. This layer also handles user authentication, authorization, and application-level services.

The OSI model provides a standardized framework for designing and implementing network protocols, enabling interoperability between diverse systems and networks. While not all networking implementations strictly adhere to the OSI model, it serves as a valuable reference for understanding and troubleshooting network communications.

# provide examples of what really is happening on each layer, show concrete changes happening with message data

Certainly, here are examples of what happens at each layer of the OSI model with a data message, illustrating the concrete changes that occur as the message travels through the layers:

1. Physical Layer:
   At the physical layer, the message data is converted into raw bits (a stream of 1s and 0s) and transmitted over the physical medium, such as a copper wire, fiber optic cable, or wireless radio signals. For example, if the message is sent over an Ethernet cable, the bits are encoded as electrical signals and transmitted over the wire.

2. Data Link Layer:
   The data link layer takes the raw bit stream from the physical layer and organizes it into frames (data packets). It adds a header containing the physical address (MAC address) of the source and destination devices, as well as error-checking information (checksums or cyclic redundancy checks). For example, if the message is sent over an Ethernet network, the data link layer would encapsulate the message into an Ethernet frame with the source and destination MAC addresses.

3. Network Layer:
   The network layer takes the framed data from the data link layer and adds its own header containing logical addresses (e.g., IP addresses) for routing purposes. It determines the best path for the data to reach its destination, often across multiple networks. For example, if the message is sent over the Internet, the network layer would add an IP header with the source and destination IP addresses.

4. Transport Layer:
   The transport layer takes the data from the network layer and adds its own header containing information for ensuring reliable end-to-end delivery, such as sequence numbers and acknowledgments (for TCP). It may also segment the data into smaller units for transmission. For example, if the message is sent using TCP, the transport layer would add a TCP header with sequence numbers and acknowledgment information.

5. Session Layer:
   The session layer establishes, maintains, and synchronizes communication sessions between applications. It may add checkpointing and recovery information to the data for maintaining session state. For example, if the message is part of a long-running communication session, the session layer may add session tokens or identifiers to the data.

6. Presentation Layer:
   The presentation layer handles data representation, such as encoding, encryption, and compression. It ensures that the data is in a format that can be understood by the receiving application. For example, if the message contains multimedia data, the presentation layer may encode or compress the data using specific formats like JPEG or MP3.

7. Application Layer:
   The application layer is where the actual data (e.g., a web page, email message, or file transfer) is generated and processed. It adds any necessary application-specific headers or formatting to the data. For example, if the message is an HTTP request for a web page, the application layer would add the HTTP headers and format the request according to the HTTP protocol.

As the message travels down the OSI model layers (from application to physical), each layer adds its own header or trailer information to the data, encapsulating the data from the layer above. This process is known as encapsulation. When the message reaches its destination, the reverse process occurs, with each layer removing its respective headers or trailers and passing the data up to the next layer until it reaches the application layer, where the original data is delivered to the receiving application.
