In the context of valor, both "standing up against" and "standing up to" can be used, but they have slightly different connotations.

**Standing up to** typically implies:

* Confronting or opposing someone or something directly
* Facing a challenge or adversary head-on
* Refusing to back down or be intimidated

Example: "She stood up to the bully and refused to let him push her around."

**Standing up against**, on the other hand, often implies:

* Opposing or resisting a particular idea, policy, or system
* Advocating for change or reform
* Taking a stance against injustice or wrongdoing

Example: "He stood up against the discriminatory laws and fought for equality."

While both phrases can be used to describe acts of valor, "standing up against" might be more suitable when describing opposition to a larger system, ideology, or injustice, whereas "standing up to" might be more fitting when describing a direct confrontation with an individual or adversary.

That being said, in many cases, both phrases can be used interchangeably, and the difference is largely a matter of nuance. If you're unsure, you can always consider the context and the specific meaning you want to convey.

In the context of the original sentence, "standing up against" could work well:

* "Whistleblowers who stand up against corruption or wrongdoing, despite personal risk."

However, if you want to emphasize the direct confrontation aspect, "standing up to" might be a better fit:

* "Whistleblowers who stand up to corrupt officials, despite personal risk."

Ultimately, the choice between "standing up against" and "standing up to" depends on the specific context and the tone you want to convey.
