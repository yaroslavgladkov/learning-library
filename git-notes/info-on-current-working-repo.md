# To see all the information about your current working repository, you can use various Git commands. Here are some of them:

**1. `git status`**:
```
git status
```
This command shows you the status of your repository, including:

* The current branch
* Any changes you've made (staged or unstaged)
* Any untracked files

**2. `git branch`**:
```
git branch -a
```
This command shows you all the branches in your repository, including:

* The current branch (marked with an asterisk `*`)
* All local branches
* All remote branches (if you have a remote repository set up)

**3. `git remote`**:
```
git remote -v
```
This command shows you the remote repositories associated with your local repository, including:

* The name of the remote repository (e.g., `origin`)
* The URL of the remote repository (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo.git`)

**4. `git config`**:
```
git config -l
```
This command shows you all the configuration settings for your repository, including:

* The repository name
* The user name and email
* The remote repository URLs
* The branch settings (e.g., which branch is set as the default)

**5. `git rev-parse`**:
```
git rev-parse --git-dir --git-work-tree --absolute-git-dir --absolute-git-work-tree
```
This command shows you various information about your repository, including:

* The path to the Git directory (`.git`)
* The path to the working tree (your repository's root directory)
* The absolute paths to the Git directory and working tree

**6. `git show`**:
```
git show --format=fuller
```
This command shows you detailed information about the current commit, including:

* The commit hash
* The author and committer information
* The commit date and time
* The commit message

**7. `git ls-remote`**:
```
git ls-remote --heads --tags origin
```
This command shows you information about the remote repository, including:

* The heads (branches) on the remote repository
* The tags on the remote repository

**Putting it all together**:

If you want to see all the information about your current working repository, you can combine some of these commands. Here's an example:
```
git status
git branch -a
git remote -v
git config -l
git rev-parse --git-dir --git-work-tree --absolute-git-dir --absolute-git-work-tree
git show --format=fuller
git ls-remote --heads --tags origin
```
This will give you a comprehensive overview of your repository's configuration, branches, remotes, and commit history.

Remember, you can always use `git help <command>` to learn more about each command and its options.
