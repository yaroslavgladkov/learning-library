I'd be happy to help you understand working with Git and GitHub.

Yes, you can initiate a Git repository locally and then add it to an already existing repository on GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

**Step 1: Create a local Git repository**

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your local Git repository. Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
```
git init
```
This will create a new `.git` folder in your directory, which will store all the Git metadata.

**Step 2: Add files to your local repository**

Add some files to your local repository using the following command:
```
git add .
```
This will stage all the files in your directory. You can also add specific files or directories using `git add <file_name>` or `git add <directory_name>`.

**Step 3: Commit your changes**

Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:
```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
This will create a new commit with the specified message.

**Step 4: Create a new repository on GitHub (if you haven't already)**

If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub. You can do this by logging into your GitHub account, clicking on the "+" button in the top right corner, and selecting "New repository".

**Step 5: Link your local repository to the GitHub repository**

To link your local repository to the GitHub repository, you need to add a remote repository. Run the following command:
```
git remote add origin <github_repository_url>
```
Replace `<github_repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository. You can find this URL on your GitHub repository page.

**Step 6: Push your local repository to GitHub**

Push your local repository to GitHub using the following command:
```
git push -u origin master
```
This will push your local repository to the GitHub repository and set the upstream tracking information.

**Step 7: Verify your repository on GitHub**

Go to your GitHub repository page and verify that your local repository has been successfully pushed. You should see your files and commit history.

That's it You've successfully initiated a local Git repository and added it to an already existing repository on GitHub.

Some additional tips:

* Make sure you have a GitHub account and are logged in to your account.
* Replace `<github_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
* If you're using an existing repository on GitHub, make sure you have the necessary permissions to push to that repository.
* If you encounter any issues, you can use `git status` and `git log` to debug your local repository.

I hope this helps Let me know if you have any further questions.

When adding a remote repository using `git remote add`, you can use either SSH or HTTPS links, depending on your preference and the security requirements of your project.

**SSH Link**

An SSH link uses the Secure Shell protocol to connect to the GitHub repository. This method is more secure and recommended if you plan to push changes frequently.

Format:
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository_name>.git
```
Example:
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:johnDoe/myproject.git
```
**HTTPS Link**

An HTTPS link uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure to connect to the GitHub repository. This method is easier to set up and works well for public repositories.

Format:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>.git
```
Example:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnDoe/myproject.git
```
**Key differences**

Here are the key differences between SSH and HTTPS links:

|  | SSH | HTTPS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | More secure, uses SSH keys | Less secure, uses username and password |
| Authentication | Uses SSH keys for authentication | Uses username and password for authentication |
| Convenience | Requires setting up SSH keys | Easier to set up, no SSH keys required |
| Frequency of use | Recommended for frequent pushes | Suitable for occasional pushes or public repositories |

**When to use each**

* Use SSH if:
	+ You plan to push changes frequently.
	+ You need a more secure connection.
	+ You're working on a private repository.
* Use HTTPS if:
	+ You're working on a public repository.
	+ You don't want to set up SSH keys.
	+ You only need to push changes occasionally.

In your case, if you're just starting out, you can use the HTTPS link. It's easier to set up, and you can always switch to SSH later if you need more security.

Remember to replace `<username>` and `<repository_name>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
