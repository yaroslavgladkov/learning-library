# You're referring to the `safe.directory` configuration variable in Git.

The `safe.directory` variable is used to specify a list of directories that are considered safe for Git to operate in. This variable is used to prevent Git from performing certain operations in directories that are not under version control or are not intended to be modified.

To delete an entry from the `safe.directory` list, you can use the following command:
```
git config --unset-all safe.directory <directory-path>
```
Replace `<directory-path>` with the path of the directory you want to remove from the `safe.directory` list.

For example, if you want to remove the directory `/path/to/some/directory` from the `safe.directory` list, you would run:
```
git config --unset-all safe.directory /path/to/some/directory
```
This will remove the specified directory from the `safe.directory` list.

Note that if you want to remove all entries from the `safe.directory` list, you can use the following command:
```
git config --unset-all safe.directory
```
This will clear the entire `safe.directory` list.

Also, you can use `git config --get-all safe.directory` to list all the directories currently in the `safe.directory` list.
