# When you create a new directory, Git doesn't automatically track it. Git only tracks files, not directories. This is because Git is a file-based version control system, and directories are just a way to organize files.

When you run `git status`, Git checks the files in your working directory against the files in the Git index (staging area) and the Git repository. Since the new directory doesn't contain any files, there's nothing for Git to track or report.

To make Git aware of the new directory, you need to add a file inside the directory or use the `git add` command with the `-A` or `--all` option. Here are a few ways to make Git track the new directory:

1. **Create a file inside the directory**: Create a file, e.g., `.gitkeep` or `README.md`, inside the new directory. This will allow Git to track the directory.
```bash
mkdir mynewdir
touch mynewdir/.gitkeep
```
2. **Use `git add -A`**: Run `git add -A` (or `git add --all`) to stage all changes, including new directories.
```bash
mkdir mynewdir
git add -A
```
3. **Use `git add <directory>`**: Run `git add` with the directory path to stage the directory.
```bash
mkdir mynewdir
git add mynewdir
```
After running one of these commands, `git status` should show the new directory as a change.

Remember, Git only tracks files, so if you want to track an empty directory, you need to add a file inside it or use one of the above methods to make Git aware of the directory.
