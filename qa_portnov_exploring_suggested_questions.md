## 1.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is quality in general? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of quality in general:

Quality refers to the degree to which a product or service meets or exceeds a customer's expectations and requirements. It is a multidimensional concept that can be viewed from different perspectives:

- Product quality refers to how well a product is designed and engineered. This includes factors like performance, reliability, durability, and other measurable attributes. High quality products are designed to function as intended with minimal defects.

- Service quality focuses on how well a service is delivered to customers. It includes factors like timeliness, consistency, accuracy, responsiveness, and professionalism in customer interactions. Quality service meets or exceeds customer service standards and expectations.

- Quality can also refer to conformance to specifications and fitness for use. A product or service has good quality if it meets its design specifications and its intended purpose. 

- Perceived quality is subjective and depends on a customer's experiences and perceptions. It may have little to do with the actual quality of a product or service. Managing customer expectations is important.

- Quality applies to processes, systems, and organizations too. Process quality involves consistency and defect reduction in operational and production processes. Organizational quality relates to culture, policies, training, and overall commitment to quality.

In summary, quality combines objective elements related to engineering, manufacturing, and systems with subjective perceptions of customers. Its key principles include customer focus, continuous improvement, management commitment, employee involvement, and measurement/data-driven approaches. Delivering high quality goods and services builds customer loyalty, reduces costs, and provides a competitive advantage.

# 6 is it possible to find/fix all the bugs in a software product before it goes to the customers? then – why test?

## 6.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. is it possible to find/fix all the bugs in a software product before it goes to the customers? then – why test? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation for why we test software even though it's not possible to find all bugs:

While it's impossible to find every single bug before software is released, testing is still incredibly valuable and necessary. Here are some key reasons why:

- Testing finds many bugs - Even if we can't find 100% of bugs, testing can still uncover a significant number of issues. The more testing that is done, the more bugs will be identified that can then be fixed before release. This directly improves software quality.

- Testing verifies main functions work - Testing focuses on validating that the core functionality and use cases work as expected. So even if minor bugs remain, we can have confidence the software works for its primary intended purposes. 

- Testing improves user experience - Bugs that slip through can negatively impact user experience. By finding and fixing bugs through testing, we ensure a smoother and more pleasant experience for our end users.

- Testing builds confidence in the development process - Thorough testing demonstrates the software has gone through rigorous validation. This builds confidence that proper processes were followed in building the software even if a few defects remain.

- Testing prevents major bugs getting through - While minor bugs may not be caught, more serious bugs that crash programs or cause major errors are much more likely to be identified and fixed through testing. These catastrophic bugs must be prevented from reaching users.

- Testing informs when software is ready to ship - Testing coverage and results tell us when the software has reached an acceptable level of quality and is ready to be released. Without testing, we have no measurable way to gauge software completeness and maturity.

So in summary, testing is crucial and valuable even though finding 100% of bugs is impossible. Well planned and executed testing improves quality, provides confidence in the software, and prevents major issues - all extremely important benefits even if some defects remain. Testing takes software from an unknown state to a known state of quality before release.




# 7 what is black/white/gray box testing?

## 7.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is black/white/gray box testing? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of black box, white box, and gray box testing:

Black box testing is a software testing method where the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. The tester only knows the inputs and expected outputs. It is also called functional testing or behavioral testing. The focus is on testing functional requirements and specifications. Some examples of black box testing techniques are boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, decision table testing, state transition testing, and use case testing.

White box testing is a testing method where the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. The tester has access to the source code, database schemas, back-end architecture etc. It is also called clear box testing or structural testing. The focus is on testing the implementation and how the system works internally. It enables doing code coverage analysis, logic coverage, branch testing, path testing etc. Some examples of white box techniques are statement testing, decision testing, condition coverage, path testing.

Gray box testing is a combination of black box and white box testing. The tester has limited knowledge of the system's internal structure and implementation. It enables testing a system end-to-end from the user's perspective, while also enabling some white box techniques like code coverage and logic coverage analysis. The focus is on testing the workflow and business logic along with some internal validation. Some examples of gray box techniques are API testing, regression testing, integration testing.

In summary, black box testing focuses on external behavior, white box testing focuses on internal structure and logic, gray box testing takes a hybrid approach balancing external behavior with some internal logic validation. Choosing the right level gives benefits of thorough testing while managing appropriate access to the system internals.




# 8 what is a bug?

## 8.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is a bug? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of what a software bug is:

A software bug refers to an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Bugs arise when there is a mismatch between the developer's mental model of how the software should work and what the code actually does. 

Some common causes of bugs include:

- Logic errors - The algorithm or logic that programmer implements does not produce the expected behavior. This leads to incorrect outputs or unintended consequences.

- Syntax errors - These are coding mistakes that lead to invalid code that will fail to compile or execute. Examples include typos, missing semicolons, unbalanced parentheses etc.

- Resource leaks - Failure to properly allocate and free memory/resources leading to crashes or performance issues over time.

- Race conditions - When the timing or ordering of events impacts the correctness of the program. Concurrent threads or processes interact in unpredictable ways.

- Edge case failures - Not properly handling rare input combinations or unexpected conditions.

- Environment issues - Bugs that arise from differences between development and production environments.

Bugs can range in severity from minor glitches to catastrophic failures. Good QA practices like extensive testing, code reviews, static analysis etc. are employed to catch bugs before software release. Debugging helps identify root causes of bugs that slipped through. Bugs reported by users are tracked, prioritized and fixed in successive versions. Swarms of bugs reflect poor software quality, while their absence indicates good quality code and testing practices.




# 9 what is an use case?

## 9.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is an use case? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of what a use case is in software testing:

A use case is a methodology used in software testing to identify and describe how users interact with a system to achieve a specific goal. It outlines the steps a user follows to perform a task or activity within the system, focusing on the user's perspective rather than technical details. 

Use cases are an important technique for requirements analysis and testing as they help uncover functional requirements and capabilities that the system must support. They enable testers to take an outside-in view of the system and understand the different ways end users will interact with it.

Some key characteristics of use cases include:

- Actor - The user or external system that will interact with the system under test to achieve a goal. This could be an end user, another system, or time-based events.

- Goal - The aim the actor wants to achieve by using the system. This should be high-level rather than a specific technical task.

- Steps - The set of actions and interactions between the actor and the system required to achieve the goal. This forms the main body of the use case.

- Precondition - Any states or requirements that must be met before the use case can begin.

- Postcondition - How the system state changes after the use case has finished, typically in relation to the goal being achieved.

When writing use cases, some best practices include:

- Using simple, non-technical language focused on user goals and steps rather than technical implementation details.

- Avoiding implementation-specific terms and concepts.

- Having a clear actor and goal for each use case.

- Outlining basic, mainstream steps - alternate flows can be added later to handle errors etc.

- Validating use cases with actual end users to ensure they reflect real-world processes and goals.

So in summary, use cases are a technique to capture functional requirements from an end user perspective. They describe realistic user interactions that help guide software testing and ensure the system delivers value to users. Effective use cases are essential for understanding what to test at a requirements level.




# 10 what is the most important impact qa can have on a product development process?

## 10.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is the most important impact qa can have on a product development process? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of the most important impact QA can have on a product development process:

Quality assurance (QA) plays a crucial role in ensuring that products meet customer expectations and business requirements. By thoroughly testing products before release, QA helps prevent defects from reaching customers. This protects the company's reputation and prevents extra costs associated with recalls or fixes after launch. 

The most significant impact QA has is validating that the product functions as intended and is free of major defects. Comprehensive testing early in the development lifecycle helps identify bugs when they are easiest and most cost-effective to fix. Finding and addressing defects before release improves product quality and reduces risk. 

In addition to functional testing, QA provides insight into overall product quality and user experience. QA feedback on usability, visual design, documentation, accessibility, and more helps the team refine and improve the product. Testing also validates that the product works as expected across different devices, platforms, browsers, and configurations. This increases compatibility and reliability.

By partnering closely with developers and product managers throughout the lifecycle, QA advocates for quality and acts as a gatekeeper before release. This increases consumer satisfaction, adoption and retention. High-quality products that meet user needs are more likely gain traction in the market.

In summary, diligent QA testing and feedback throughout development reduces defects, improves quality, and validates usability and compatibility. This prevents issues down the line, enhances customer satisfaction, and increases the product's success and acceptance. QA provides immense value by safeguarding product quality and advocating for the end user.




# 11 What is negative testing? positive?

## 11.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is negative testing? what is positive testing? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of negative and positive testing:

Positive testing, also known as functional testing, is the process of testing software to verify that the system works as intended and meets the specified requirements. The goal of positive testing is to ensure that the major functions of the system operate correctly. Some examples of positive tests would be:

- Verifying that a user can successfully log in with valid credentials
- Checking that a payment transaction completes successfully when valid payment information is provided  
- Confirming that a file uploads successfully to the server

In positive testing, test cases are based on the software requirements and specifications. The tests are designed to show that the system performs the intended functions correctly. 

Negative testing, also known as non-functional testing, focuses on finding bugs, errors, and vulnerabilities in the system. The goal of negative testing is to deliberately make the system fail in order to identify defects and areas for improvement. Negative tests are designed without specific reference to the software specifications. Some examples of negative tests include:

- Trying to log in with invalid credentials to see how the system handles unauthorized access
- Entering invalid payment information to verify the system's error handling
- Testing upload limits by attempting to upload overly large files
- Submitting empty fields in a web form to check required field validations
- Entering invalid data types to check input validation 

In negative testing, the tester is not concerned with verifying intended functionality. Rather, the goal is to break or crash the system by providing unexpected, random, or invalid inputs. This helps reveal bugs and security issues that positive testing alone may not uncover. Effective negative testing requires creativity, intuition, and skill to discover edge cases not covered in the specifications.

In summary, positive testing aims to verify correct functioning, while negative testing aims to identify incorrect functioning. Together, they provide a comprehensive assessment of software quality and reliability. Using both positive and negative testing strategies is important for thorough software testing.


## 11.1.1 explain in details how positive/negative testing corresponds to functional/non-functional testing. are this terms completely interchangeable?

You raise a good point - the relationship between positive/negative testing and functional/non-functional testing can be confusing, as the terms are sometimes used interchangeably but do have some distinctions. Let me try to explain the differences in more detail:

Functional testing refers to testing a system against its documented functional requirements and specifications. The goal is to verify that each specified function works as intended. Positive testing aligns closely with functional testing, as positive tests are based on requirements and specifications. However, positive testing is focused specifically on verifying the intended behaviors, while functional testing is a broader approach that verifies all documented functions.

Non-functional testing refers to testing aspects of a system that are not related to explicit functions, but rather to quality attributes such as usability, performance, security, etc. Negative testing is concerned with identifying issues, which often relates to non-functional aspects. However, negative testing uses a scattershot approach without regard to specifications, while non-functional testing is systematic and targeted.

So in summary:

- Positive testing and functional testing have significant overlap in verifying intended functional behavior according to specifications. However functional testing is a broader approach.

- Negative testing and non-functional testing have some relationship in their focus on quality attributes and finding defects. However, non-functional testing is planned systematically while negative testing uses a random approach.

The terms are not completely interchangeable:

- Positive/negative testing are defined by their intent - either verifying correct behavior or finding incorrect behavior. 

- Functional/non-functional testing are defined by their scope - verifying documented functions or verifying quality attributes.

Their purposes overlap in some areas but are distinct in others. Using both positive/negative and functional/non-functional strategies together provides comprehensive testing coverage. The terms are related but not identical. Let me know if this helps explain the distinction!




# 12 which type of testing results in highest number of bugs found?

## 12.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. which type of testing leads to highest number of bugs found? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation on which type of testing leads to the highest number of bugs found:

Exploratory testing tends to find the most bugs during software testing. In exploratory testing, the tester actively controls the design and execution of tests as they are performed. This provides the tester the freedom to dynamically change direction and pursue new areas of interest as they test. Exploratory testing relies on the tester's knowledge, skill and intuition to steer the testing rather than following a pre-determined test plan. 

Some key reasons why exploratory testing finds a high number of bugs:

- It is an unscripted form of testing where the tester is not limited to set test cases. This provides the freedom to explore the software in ways a scripted test would not cover. The tester can interact with the software as an actual user would, trying different workflows and usage patterns. This leads to finding bugs scripts would miss.

- It allows testers to adapt the testing in real-time based on what they are learning as they test. Testers can pursue new ideas or problematic areas on the fly rather than having to update rigid test cases. This ability to dynamically adapt the testing helps reveal many corner case bugs.

- Exploratory testing leverages the tester's skill, intuition and domain experience. The tester relies on their judgment to test areas they suspect could be prone to bugs based on their knowledge. This helps effectively focus testing on the most critical parts of the software.

- It provides a creative, context-driven approach to testing. Testers can make contextual observations and try experiments while testing to trigger hard-to-find bugs. This enables finding defects that may be missed by formal scripted tests.

In summary, the freedom, adaptability, context-sensitivity and leveraging of human thought and skill during exploratory testing allows finding a greater number and variety of bugs compared to scripted test case execution. This makes it a very powerful technique for bug detection in software testing.




# 13 what is the software development life cycle?

## 13.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is the software development life cycle? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of the software development life cycle (SDLC):

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for designing, building, testing, and deploying a software product. It consists of the following key phases:

1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis: This initial phase focuses on understanding the needs and goals of the client or user. Requirements are gathered through interviews, surveys, business analysis, market research, and other methods. The requirements are then analyzed, categorized as functional or non-functional, prioritized, and documented in a requirements specification document. 

2. System Design: In this phase, software architects and developers create high-level and low-level designs to provide a blueprint for the software. This includes defining the overall system architecture, interfaces, components, modules, data structures, algorithms, and hardware/software specifications. Key deliverables are a system design document, interface design document, and database design document.

3. Implementation: The source code is written, compiled, and unit tested in this phase based on the system design. Programming tools, frameworks, and coding standards are established. Code repositories are set up and version control is implemented. Unit testing verifies the functionality of individual modules.

4. Integration and Testing: The individually tested modules are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure the software requirements are met. Integration testing checks the interactions between integrated modules. System testing validates the entire system for correctness and completeness. Test cases are executed manually or using automation tools. Bugs and defects are logged, tracked, and fixed.

5. Deployment: The software is delivered or installed in a production environment and user acceptance testing is performed in real-world scenarios. The DevOps team handles activities like release planning, environment setup, migration, security, performance tuning, configuration, and training users if needed.  

6. Maintenance: It involves addressing issues, fixing bugs, improving usability or performance, upgrading interfaces, adding new capabilities, and adapting to new platforms. This phase continues throughout the lifetime of the software.

The SDLC provides a well-planned approach to software development with orderly stages, guidelines, reviews, and milestones. It ensures quality through requirements, design, coding, and testing standards. Following the SDLC leads to higher customer satisfaction, lower costs, reliable timelines, and minimized project risks.


## 13.1.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is the software development life cycle? what are its phases? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and its phases:

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates. 

The SDLC consists of the following phases:

1. Planning and Requirement Analysis: This is the initial stage where the requirements of the proposed software are gathered by analyzing the needs of users and the market. Business analysts create the business requirements document, software requirements specification document and other requirement documents.

2. Defining and Designing: The requirements specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and the software architecture is defined. System design specifications are created including interface design, database design and architecture diagrams. 

3. Software Development: The actual coding takes place in this phase. The software design is translated into code using a suitable programming language. Software developers write code using frameworks and tools like Git. Unit testing is done in this phase by developers.

4. Testing: This phase involves testing the codes and fixing the errors and bugs. QA and testing team perform different types of testing like unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing. The final build is tested rigorously to ensure software works as expected.

5. Deployment: Once the software testing phase concludes successfully, the product is deployed in the production environment. It is first installed in a test environment identical to production servers. After thorough testing, it is scheduled for deployment in the production environment.

6. Maintenance: This phase involves maintenance and updates to the system after it is deployed. As requirements change and new features are proposed, changes are made to the existing software. Fixing bugs and improving usability also takes place in this phase.

In summary, the SDLC provides a sequential framework of the tasks performed at each stage to develop and maintain software. Understanding the SDLC phases enables developers and testers to collaborate effectively to deliver a high-quality software product.




# 14 what are the levels of testing?

## 15.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what are the levels of testing? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of the main levels of software testing:

Unit Testing
- Tests individual components or units of code, like functions or classes, in isolation from the rest of the system. Typically done by developers. Helps verify that each small part works as expected.

Integration Testing 
- Verifies that different modules or services in an application work well together. Tests the interfaces between components and interaction with dependencies. Ensures proper data flow and communication between integrated units.

System Testing
- Validates the entire system as a whole. Tests overall functionalities and end-to-end scenarios from a user's perspective. Ensures the full system meets requirements. Includes functional, performance, security, and other testing types.

Acceptance Testing 
- Formal testing with customer involvement to determine if the system satisfies business needs and is acceptable for delivery. Includes user acceptance testing (UAT) where actual users test the system. Confirms the system is validated from the business perspective.

Regression Testing
- Testing existing and unchanged functionality after changes have been made elsewhere in the software. Verifies that bugs have not been introduced or uncovered in other areas of the system as a result of the changes. Regression tests are typically automated to run after changes.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions! I'm happy to explain software testing concepts in more detail.


## 14.1.1 what is the generalized base for this classification?

The main basis for classifying different levels of software testing is the scope and focus of what is being tested at each level:

- Unit testing focuses on the smallest unit of code, an individual function, class, or module. The scope is isolated code components.

- Integration testing looks at interactions between modules and how they combine together. The scope expands to communication between integrated units.  

- System testing looks at the software as a whole. The scope covers entire end-to-end functionalities and workflows.

- Acceptance testing validates that the system meets business and user requirements. The scope is fulfilling the system's intended use cases.

- Regression testing re-runs existing tests to check for regressions. The scope includes verifying unchanged areas of the system.

So in summary, the levels move from narrow scope testing the smallest pieces, to wide scope testing the entire integrated system, with different testing purposes at each stage. 

The main generalization is around expanding scope from isolated units to overall system, while having distinct testing goals for each level. This classification helps structure software testing efforts by breaking up the complex task into levels with clear focus areas and purposes. Let me know if this helps explain the generalized basis!

Reviewing the technical specifications allows you to understand the architecture and internal components of the system. This helps inform boundary and integration test cases to validate that modules/components interact as expected. Pay close attention to any technical dependencies, constraints, and edge cases called out.

UX/UI Design Mockups
Mockups and wireframes for the user interface design showcase the intended look, feel, and flow of the application. Analyze these to create test cases for the UI aesthetics and ergonomics. Verifying the UI matches the mocks is an important aspect of testing.

User Manuals/Help Guides
Manuals demonstrate the intended functionality and workflows from an end user's perspective. Review these to understand how users are supposed to interact with the various features. Identify logical use cases and create test cases that will validate the software works as documented. This helps ensure the manuals accurately reflect system capabilities.

Previous Test Cases/Defect Reports
Existing test cases and defect reports contain a wealth of knowledge based on past testing efforts. Reuse or reference these artifacts to avoid duplication and leverage lessons learned. Analyze previous defects to target high risk areas and prevent regressions.

Traceability Matrices
Traceability matrices map requirements to corresponding test cases. Review these to ensure test coverage aligns with the requirements. Identify any gaps where requirements may be missing test cases and develop additional tests. The matrices also provide visibility into which tests should be rerun if a requirement changes.

# 28 what is gui testing?

## 28.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is gui testing? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of GUI testing:

GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing is a type of software testing that involves testing the graphical interface of an application. The purpose of GUI testing is to ensure that the visual elements of the application like windows, buttons, menus, icons, etc. are functioning correctly and meeting the requirements. 

Some key aspects of GUI testing:

- It focuses on validating the look, feel and functionality of graphical user interface components like menus, tabs, forms, images and more. The layout, alignment, size, color, scrolls and navigation of the visual elements are tested.

- It is performed from an end user's perspective rather than testing the code behind the GUI. The tests aim to simulate real user interactions and workflows.

- GUI tests can be carried out manually by testers exploring the application or can be automated using dedicated GUI testing tools like Selenium, Ranorex, TestComplete etc.

- Testing activities involve checking that all UI elements are displayed correctly on the screen, all images and fonts are properly rendered, navigation and workflows are working as intended, UI is responsive for various devices and resolutions etc.

- Some common tests include the appearance of forms, fields, buttons, dropdowns, dialog boxes, date pickers. Their layout, colors, alignment, labeling, functionality are validated. Error messages are verified.

- Interactions like entering data, clicking buttons, drag and drop, swiping, zooming in/out are tested to check for the right behavior and output.

In summary, GUI testing is critical to ensure a smooth visual interface and interaction for the end users of an application. A systematic approach to GUI testing can uncover defects and usability issues early. Automation helps efficiently execute repetitive GUI test cases.




# 29 where the gui standards are coming from?

## 29.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. where the gui standards are coming from? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of where GUI standards come from:

Graphical user interface (GUI) standards have evolved over time through a combination of industry consensus, technical constraints, and user expectations. Here are some of the key factors that have shaped GUI standards:

- Operating systems - Major operating systems like Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android provide built-in GUI frameworks and human interface guidelines that influence GUI standards. For example, Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for iOS apps set conventions for navigation, terminology, and visual design that most iOS developers follow.

- Technical constraints - The capabilities and limitations of display hardware, input devices, and graphics rendering impose technical constraints that shape GUI design. For example, the relatively low resolution of early computer displays made icons and images crude and low-detail. Higher resolution displays allow more refined and detailed GUI elements today.

- Consistency - Users benefit from consistency in GUI layout and behavior across different applications. Following platform and OS conventions allows for a more consistent user experience. This motivates developers to adhere to established standards.

- Accessibility - GUI standards aim to ensure interfaces are usable for people with disabilities. Guidelines like Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) set standards for keyboard navigation, color contrast, screen reader compatibility, and more.

- User testing - Iterative user testing helps refine GUI standards over time. When users struggle with certain interfaces, developers respond by updating standards to prevent similar issues.

- New input methods - The introduction of new input methods like touchscreens, voice commands, and VR/AR has necessitated updating standards for how users interact with GUI elements.

- Competition - Major platforms like Windows and macOS compete for developer mindshare. Having clear, well-documented GUI standards makes a platform more appealing to developers.

In summary, GUI standards are not handed down by any central authority. They evolve over time through a complex interplay of technology, user expectations, developer consensus, and competition between platforms. But the end goal is to create interfaces that are consistent, intuitive, and accessible to the broadest range of users.
